We were a part of 2 different competencies within Satyam. The project had a huge team, first time integration of DCTM with struts, complex and colossal requirements coupled with government as a client. The project lasted for around 1.5 year and all along I found Sriram an inspiring personality. He had a quick grab of the most complex requirements and step by step provided a technical solution to it. He had demonstrated a great architectural capability in designing the solution and was a mentor / problem solver / go-getter for the team. At the fag end of the project he had a tremendous contribution in getting a buy in from the client and to close the project to the utmost satisfaction of the entire stakeholder. I will be always willing to work with him and wish him best in all his future endeavors.!",
